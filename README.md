# CulturKo #

## Basic information ##

A game that makes use of the Internet of Things concept.
It's created for Cracow tourists and citzens. Players can visit virtual version of Cracow and at some places they can play mini games, like quizes or
simple arcade games. The main point of the app is that they have to be in the same position in the real Cracow at the time.
Users can win prizes like restaurant discounts and learn a lot about Cracow history and culture. 

## How does it look ##
Here's the video I made with my team to promote the project at Inspiring Hacks Hackathon.

Thanks to the organizes of the Inspiring Hacks Hackathon. <br/>
Current version is just a very simple game. Only a small test map (which is not very similar to Cracow) with no gps integration is implemented.
